Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(docs): Add initial README with project overview

Added basic README.md file outlining the project goals and planned features. The README provides initial context for the project's purpose - implementing custom PyTorch Dataset classes for token-based data processing with automatic padding support.

This establishes the project's scope and helps future contributors (or ourselves) understand what we're building. At this early stage, the README outlines planned features while actual implementation will follow in subsequent commits.
