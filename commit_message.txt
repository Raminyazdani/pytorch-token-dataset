Implemented CSVDataset class to extend the project's capabilities beyond token sequences to structured tabular data:
- Reads CSV files using pandas
- Extracts features and target columns
- Implements one-hot encoding for categorical labels
- Follows the same Dataset interface as TokenDataset

OOPS - This commit has a bug! The code uses pd.read_csv() but pandas is not imported anywhere in the notebook. This will cause a NameError when trying to instantiate CSVDataset.

This is a common mistake when adding new functionality - forgetting to add the necessary import statement for a new library. The bug will be caught and fixed in the next commit during testing.
