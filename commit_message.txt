Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(deps): Add requirements.txt with core dependencies

Added requirements.txt specifying the core Python dependencies needed for the project: PyTorch for the Dataset interface and tensor operations, NumPy for numerical computing, scikit-learn for train/validation splitting utilities, and Jupyter for the notebook development environment.

At this stage, we're including only the dependencies needed for the core TokenDataset functionality. Additional dependencies (like pandas for CSV support) will be added later when that functionality is implemented.

This allows developers to set up the project environment and ensures reproducibility.
