Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(data): Add JSON and CSV data files for demonstrations

Added real data files to enable testing and demonstration of the dataset classes:
- data.json: Contains 5,574 token sequences with corresponding labels for TokenDataset testing
- data.csv: Contains 708 rows of structured medical symptom data with disease diagnoses

These data files provide realistic examples for demonstrating:
- Variable-length sequence handling with TokenDataset
- Structured tabular data processing (for future CSVDataset)
- Train/validation splitting functionality
- DataLoader batch processing

Data files are placed in the repository root for easy access and portability. The JSON format supports the existing TokenDataset implementation, while CSV data will be used when CSV support is added.
