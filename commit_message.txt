Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(docs): Add project identity and documentation structure

Started adding portfolio metadata files but made a mistake in the README format. Added placeholder project identity but the README got corrupted during editing - it now has "OOPS: Wrong title format!" in it instead of the proper professional content.

This represents a realistic scenario where you're working on multiple files and accidentally save a work-in-progress version with notes/comments that shouldn't be in the final version. This happens when switching between editing modes or when copy-pasting goes wrong.

Will need to fix the README in the next commit to restore the proper portfolio-ready format.
