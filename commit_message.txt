Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(core): Add TokenDataset class skeleton

Created initial notebook structure with TokenDataset class definition. Implemented the basic class skeleton extending torch.utils.data.Dataset with placeholder methods for __init__, __len__, and __getitem__.

Added necessary imports for PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader, JSON handling, NumPy arrays, and sklearn's train_test_split utility. This establishes the foundation for implementing the complete dataset functionality in the next commits.

The skeleton follows PyTorch's Dataset interface requirements and sets up the structure for handling token-based data with automatic padding.
