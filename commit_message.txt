Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(init): Add .gitignore for Python/Jupyter project

Initial repository setup with comprehensive .gitignore patterns. Added exclusions for Python bytecode, build artifacts, virtual environments, Jupyter notebook checkpoints, IDE configuration files, and OS-specific files. This ensures a clean repository from the start by preventing temporary and generated files from being committed.

This is the first step in establishing proper repository hygiene and follows industry best practices for Python project initialization.
