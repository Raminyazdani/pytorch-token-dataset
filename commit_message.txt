Ramin Yazdani | pytorch-token-dataset | main | WIP(docs): Enhance README with comprehensive documentation

Significantly improved the README.md with comprehensive documentation:
- Added detailed repository structure section
- Included complete setup and installation instructions
- Added step-by-step usage guide
- Documented data file formats and locations
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues
- Included reproducibility notes

The README now provides all the information needed for someone to:
- Understand the project's purpose and approach
- Set up the development environment
- Run the notebook successfully
- Troubleshoot common problems
- Understand the data requirements

This transforms the basic README into professional documentation suitable for a portfolio project.
